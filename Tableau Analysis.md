New York City Bike Analysis:

Used csv files: JC-202211 and JC-202212. 
These two files are cleaned in Panda Data Frame and merged them with “Ride Id”. The merged file is saved as “merged_df2.csv” in the local machines. Then the merged file is connected to the Tableau interface. Initially ‘merged_df2.csv” has 724300 Rows and 25 Columns.
